                        <p id="isi">On Saturday, 3rd October 2020, around 10 minutes before the Talk Show started, our Zoom room was already joined by Michail Stangl (Boiler Room & CTM Festival). Our own Hendy Kana Tripo 3000 had a little catching up with Michail Stangl before the Talk Show started. We had over 50 people join the conversation, they are raging from Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Malang, Yogyakarta, Bali, Perth, and Cologne. Wide enthusiasm from Boiler Room Jakarta and Boiler Room Indonesia friends that join us in the session. We also received some interesting thoughts poured into questions from all the participants from across the Nation. The Survive/Save/Sustain Talk Show begins at 5 PM, it’s around 12 afternoons in Berlin. This session is room to discuss and share about how each one of us as individuals and as a community member can do something for the industry in this uncertain time. Our viewers range far across from countries, and can't wait to see the whole talk show at the moment with Michail Stangl. Boiler Room Jakarta and also Boiler Room Bali streamers are excited to join in this event. So how about the CTM Festival Jakarta zest? Let's say hi first to Bali that successfully held the Boiler Room Bali session in a not past a long time ago.  <br>

                        Back to our Michail Stangl aka Opium Hum, he has been for over a decade being one of the progressive forces behind the global underground music scene, converging avant-garde, pop, and underground culture. As one of the Boiler Room leads curators and faces, platforming favorite artists in off-club locations & blowing it up online. He contributed in the past ten years significantly to Boiler Room's phenomenal rise to become the world’s leading underground music platform. The remarkable spirit that brings the Boiler Room and CTM Festival to global. Many friends and communities had a big interest in these events, the same spirit like Boiler Room Bali in the last December 2019 that excites us. We will look furthermore from some extras like the Boiler Room Indonesia session who will be coming up next, as well as CTM Festival Indonesia events. The Boiler Room itself is a global online music broadcasting platform that streams live music around the world. The platform itself was founded in London, England, in 2010, and now hosts shows in around 100 cities around the world, from Stockholm to Shanghai. Their music program initially focused on electronic music such as house, techno, dubstep but was quickly expanded to include additional genres, including grime, hip hop, classical, as well as jazz. <br><br>The Boiler Room itself has been watched by up to 400,000 people. Michail is also one of the curators of the annual CTM Festival, one of the world’s most important happenings for experimental and new forms of club music. As CTM Festival Jakarta or CTM Festival Indonesia fans know the hype has been running series of cutting-edge events at the world-famous Berghain club, including co-running Leisure System and his own ≠ (not equal) events and DJs internationally as Opium Hum. On our Zoom session Survive/Save/Sustain, we discussed how we can contribute to survive, save and sustain in this uncertain time and shared some thoughts on how each one of us individually and as a community member can do something for the industry. Many of our communities miss the rave party such as the CTM Festival that lasts held in Berlin in the first 2020.<br>

                        As we do know we want the crowd here in Jakarta to still have that kind of spirit. We agree and look forward to the session of turning events like Boiler Room Indonesia or CTM Festival Indonesia will be held soon. "In a matter of time we would see our future collaborations, with many music artists around the Nation," said Hendy Kana Tripo 3000. So the question is how to contribute more to this uncertain time? as what Hendy Kana Tripo  3000 and friends still did until now and keep the excitement at the table. Tripo 3000 organizing parties for more than 11 years, share the passions in a music festival that creates a kind of Utopian space and try to build them according to the specific theme as you may see a DJ set now going up more within an online session, with a live streaming channel.<br><br> Aside from arranging parties, Tripo 3000 is actively helping communities from various cities across Indonesia to grow and connect with each other through electronic music.<br><br> Michail Stangl more deeply shared his opinion and told everyone to be an activist in whatever field that you’re passionate about and don’t believe in the global system and If you are interested in anything western, reflect and think about the talents within your local community first. Support yourself by supporting your local community, build and enrich your own ecosystem. Just remember, Collaboration > Competition, so we’re #StrongerTogether in this industry. Put it to work, don't stop to produce more music and creations to continue thriving. Who knows in the future collaboration will bring Boiler Room Jakarta, Boiler Room Bali, or Boiler Room Indonesia, and even more, the CTM Festival Jakarta session will be here in upcoming years.

If we can't stop, don't stop, keep being honest about who we are, and keep digging your passion and unlimited ourselves. He sees these situations as a good opportunity for being more joint, combining our interests to still have fun and productive, share it with other friends and neighbors. So maybe we can see some quick Boiler Room Jakarta is around the corner. Major throwbacks as the Tripomatica have that kind of fire and still dance it till now as Tripo 3000. We're even thrilled to bring more like CTM Festival Jakarta, or even better the CTM Festival Indonesia will be here too as Hendy Kana said.<br><br> We would like to thank everyone who joined the Talk Show, we had such really great talks and discussion about Survive/Save/Sustain for our music industry. Thank you for our friends from Boiler Room Jakarta, Boiler Room Bali, and Boiler Room Indonesia. Our hope and prayers will still be in our communities, so we are grateful for this opportunity, may we have more to come.

                    The Boiler Room itself is a global online music broadcasting platform that streams live music around the world. The platform itself was founded in London, England, in 2010, and now hosts shows in around 100 cities around the world, from Stockholm to Shanghai. Their music program initially focused on electronic music such as house, techno, dubstep but was quickly expanded to include additional genres, including grime, hip hop, classical, as well as jazz. The Boiler Room itself has been watched by up to 400,000 people. Michail is also one of the curators of the annual CTM Festival, one of the world’s most important happenings for experimental and new forms of club music. As CTM Festival Jakarta or CTM Festival Indonesia fans know the hype has been running series of cutting-edge events at the world-famous Berghain club, including co-running Leisure System and his own ≠ (not equal) events and DJs internationally as Opium Hum.

                    On our Zoom session Survive/Save/Sustain, we discussed how we can contribute to survive, save and sustain in this uncertain time and shared some thoughts on how each one of us individually and as a community member can do something for the industry. Many of our communities miss the rave party such as the CTM Festival that lasts held in Berlin in the first 2020.</p>
